# US-Bike-Share-System-Analysis-Project

In this project, I used python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major
bikeshare systems in the United States. I performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from
the three systems and wrote code to compute descriptive statistics using the Jupyter notebook
environment.
